## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Customer Dynamics, security is taken seriously. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities, please report them to our security team immediately. We appreciate your help in making C3 for Webex CC safe for everyone.

To report a security vulnerability, please create a new [security advisory in GitHub](https://github.com/customer-dynamics/c3-webex-cc/security/advisories/new) with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. Our security team will respond to your report promptly and work with you to address the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please allow us sufficient time to assess and address any reported vulnerabilities before disclosing them publicly. We aim to acknowledge and resolve security issues in a timely manner and will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all versions of C3 for Webex CC and any associated dependencies.

## Vulnerability Management
